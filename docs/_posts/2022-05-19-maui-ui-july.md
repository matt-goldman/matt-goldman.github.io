Back in 2019 [Steven Thewissen](https://thewissen.io/) gave us the awesome [Xamarin UI July](https://thewissen.io/introducing-xamarin-ui-july/). Steven described it like an advent calendar, where each day throughout the month you would have a new awesome Xamarin UI blog post to open.

Let's do it again this year for .NET MAUI! Every day throughout July, a community contributed blog post or video will be published showing some awesome UI magic in .NET MAUI. 

This time around we'll extend the scope to include videos as well as blog posts. The videos and blog posts will be in English, and each one will be about a specific topic related to UI in .NET MAUI. It can be showing off a beautiful UI or control that someone has crafted, or it can be teaching how to use some aspect of building a UI in .NET MAUI.


## How to get involved
If you want to participate, shout out on Twitter using the hashtags #dotnetmaui and #MAUIUIJuly, saying which day of the month you want to release your post or video on. Once you've picked a date I'll add your name to the list below to reserve your spot.

Then get started on your content! Keep the following in mind:

1. The topic must be related to UI in .NET MAUI
2. Your blog post or video must be in English
3. Link back to this post in your blog post or in the description of your video
4. Publish your blog post or video on the date according to the list below
5. Post a link to your video or blog post on Twitter, using the hashtags #dotnetmaui and #MAUIUIJuly

That's it! Looking forward to seeing what you all come up with :)
