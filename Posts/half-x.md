Today I was thinking about a minor injury I'm dealing with (just something very minor and inconsequential), and that there's a small lifestyle change I need to make to help prevent it happening again (specifically, taking up Vinyasa yoga), and I fell back to a familiar internal response:

> I'll add it to the list of things to do when I have time.

It's something I've thought too many times to count, and I'm sure many of you have too. This time, though, I reflected on it, and it bothers me that we've normalised this.

I recently read a blog post arguing that the "10x developer" myth is now real, and that with AI we all need to "get our heads in the game" and become 10x workers.

I'm sure most of us feel this, even get a thrill out of it. I know I do. I'm way more productive now than I was 2 years ago, and I won't deny that I love it. But we're so caught up in the race to capitalise on this new technology that we rarely pause to ask whether we're even asking the right questions.

When I took a step back and thought about it, I realised this isn't what I want from AI.

AI wasn't supposed to make us 10x workers.
It was supposed to make us 0.1x workers.

Many of you will have seen this quote from Joanna Maciejewska:

<img src="/images/posts/authorjmac-tweet.png" width="500" alt="You know what the biggest problem with pushing all-things-AI is? Wrong direction. I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.">

And you know what? It's funny, but it's not a joke. Her other comments in the thread add some context, but the core point is simple: she's not advocating for creating robot slaves. She's asking why we're using AI to take over the things that bring us joy, instead of the things that make us miserable (and, frankly, the things most of us are bad at; her example was doing taxes).

And I have to wonder - if AI genuinely increases productivity, why is the default assumption that we must 10x output instead of maintaining output and reducing input?

I'm not saying everyone should do that, I'm just concerned that it barely even enters the conversation.

Maciejewska made a great point, but I'm talking about something even more fundamental. We already know this pattern well. We are culturally neglecting our health in the pursuit of profit, then acting surprised at the outcomes, talking about an "obesity pandemic" as if it appeared out of nowhere. We keep treating health as "extra", something you do outside work, after work, when you're lucky enough to have time and energy, not just after work but after all the other necessary things that consume our daily lives.

But we need to stop treating it like an optional extra, because it's not. It's infrastructure. I don't think this position needs defending, but if you want to look at it through a business lens, consider this: healthy, happy, focused people are more productive. That's not an opinion, that's an empirically established fact.

But even setting business value aside for a second, there's a more basic question here about decency.

It's nearly 2026. We live in a world of unprecedented wealth and technological capability, yet in the wealthiest nation on Earth, more than a tenth of the population lives below the poverty line, and people  still die from preventable and treatable conditions because they cannot afford to live. Somehow this is normal.

Every major technological shift becomes an opportunity to squeeze more out of workers, not to give anything back. But this isn't the 19th century, it's the 21st. AI isn't the first industrial revolution, it's the fourth. People in the past didn't have the benefit of hindsight. We do.

I suspect many of you are still trying to figure out how to measure the productivity gains from AI. That's a whole other conversation (and I'm happy to help), so here's my suggestion heading into 2026: 
If you're seeing gains, give some of that time back.
Not as forced "wellness culture" (I won't pretend that phrase doesn't dredge up thoughts so cringe it's practically become a trope), not as performative initiatives. Just as a baseline assumption that work should not consume the very thing that makes people able to work in the first place.

Life, objectively, is better than it has ever been for those of us living in the West and above the poverty line. And yet many of us still move through our days exhausted, anxious, and not just short on time, but in the red.

So here's my final thought. When I say we should give some of that time back, I don't just mean as leaders or employers. I mean to ourselves as well. If AI lets you 10x your productivity, great. Consider 5x-ing it instead. Take the other half and invest it where it actually matters: your health, your family, your relationships, your sense of meaning.

We don't need permission to do this. We owe it to ourselves to stop treating our wellbeing as a deferred task, and start treating it as part of the work of living.
