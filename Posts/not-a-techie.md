There's an old myth in the tech industry: deep technical expertise and effective leadership are mutually exclusive. It's a myth that until recently I thought we'd left behind, with only outdated characters in low-grade sitcoms giving it airtime. But recently I heard this myth regurgitated in the context of a conversation between two much-respected professionals, which made me realise that it's still alive and well.

**Myth #1: Highly specialised experts can't communicate in everyday language.**

During the conversation, one of them remarked that while some of his technical colleagues were exceptionally smart, they lacked the ability to communicate clearly with non-technical stakeholders.

He also went on to say he noticed that no matter what the problem – technical or otherwise – in most cases, his technical colleagues could only think in terms of technical solutions.

**Myth #2: Highly specialised experts are shackled by golden hammers.**

I've touched on this before, many times, both here and on the [Beer Driven Devs podcast](https://www.beerdriven.dev). It surprises me to see this particular myth persisting - after all, the existence of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a direct refutation of both myths.

I've toyed with talking about this myth but as I mentioned, until very recently I considered it a thing of the past. Hearing it mentioned again though, and by such highly respected people, made me realise it's time to call it out once more.

Let's examine why these myths so stubbornly resist their consignment to history. Is it because they describe reality, or is it because they provide comfort to those who feel threatened by that reality?

## “I’m not a techie”

About twenty years ago, I was acting IT manager at a small company. It was a hands-on role, a tiny team, limited resources, the usual chaos. I was young and relatively inexperienced, but capable, communicative, and ambitious.

When the permanent role was advertised, we received quite a few applicants, and despite being advertised as hands-on, a few of the candidates were not from technical backgrounds.

One in particular, who the HR manager had taken a liking to, proudly declared during her interview:

> "I’m not a techie."

I asked - reasonably, in my opinion - how she planned to make decisions about the department without understanding the technology. Her response was that she'd be relying on me for that information.

I'll admit I actually liked her, and in other circumstances would have been happy to work with her. But in that moment, two thoughts flashed:

The first - then why do we need you?
And the second - so  you're effectively saying that you’re going to take credit for my successes and blame me for your failures.

Perhaps that's unfair but it feels like a logical interpretation of the situation.

This isn't unique to tech, nor is it a new problem. We can see examples of this going back decades, if not centuries. But there _is_ a modern twist to it that _is_ unique to IT. (I'll cover this later, but to be fair, and to provide the right context, I _do_ believe this problem is not as prevalent as it once was.)

In other professions, subject-matter expertise is a prerequisite for leadership. Would we appoint a non-medico to a Head of Surgery position? Would someone say "I’m not an accountant but I can manage the heck out of a finance department"?

Whilst in other fields we see expertise as the basis for leadership, in tech, we somehow decided it’s optional.

## “I don’t know, and I don’t want to know.”

It seems hard to imagine someone working in any other field proudly declaring ignorance of their domain. But a project manager I once worked with literally employed this as his catchphrase.

> I don’t know, and I don’t want to know.

He said it often and proudly. He wore it like a badge of honour, as if ignorance was a leadership style. The idea was that he “focused on delivery” while the rest of us worried about “details”.

But the reality is that the details _were_ the work, and when delivery happened on his projects (which was rare), it was _in spite_ of his approach. Just like everyone else in every other profession, the hands-on folks figured out how to work around their constraints.

It’s astonishing how many people mistake detachment for decisiveness. 'Getting things done' isn’t a substitute for understanding what you’re doing. 'Things' are not fungible; you have to actually deliver on your commitments, not the illusion of progress.

## The Hands-On Fallacy

What these anecdotes share is a belief that leadership and expertise are mutually exclusive — that people with technical expertise can’t lead, and people who lead don’t need it.

This is what I call _the specialist myth_ because it's not constrained to tech: the idea that deep technical (in the generic sense) skill comes at the expense of communication, empathy and strategic thinking.

It's bullshit, but for many, it's _convenient_ bullshit.

Convenient because it lets insecure managers claw back relevance and flatters those who lack depth, and because it turns _competence_ into a liability.

## The Dot-Com Reversal

You can trace the modern form of this back to the dot-com boom.

Before that, tech was niche. The 'nerds' built things quietly, largely ignored by the business aristocracy. Then the web happened, and suddenly the nerds _mattered_. Some of them even got rich.

This was a problem. The social hierarchy was out of balance, and that could not be tolerated.

Almost overnight, a new mythological figure formed: the visionary non-technical founder, the 'idea guy', the business mind who made the magic happen while the geeks tinkered in the basement.

:::sidenote
The most emblematic figurehead of this archetype is probably Steve Jobs.

People love to talk about the delicate balance between Jobs and Wozniak, but even those who acknowledge the importance of both sides often get it wrong. They fail to recognise that Steve Jobs _did_ have _profound_ technical understanding. Even though he wasn't the one writing the code, he understood the technology deeply enough to guide its development, challenge assumptions and push boundaries.

Yes, Jobs brought an aspect to Apple's leadership that it needed, but he wouldn't have been able to do that without understanding the technology at a fundamental level. I'll touch on this more at the end.
:::

I remember being in a computer shop 20 or so years ago, probably looking for an IDE cable or a new mouse or something. A well-dressed man (read: suit) in his late 50s walked in and was approached by a shaggy-looking IT nerd manning the floor. When asked if he needed help, the sui said:

> Yes, we’re starting an e-business. What software do I need?

It seems innocent enough, but coded in that one sentence is a whole layer cake of assumptions we can unpack:

* He believed he could start an "e-business", without any idea of what that means
* He believed that the _technical capability_ to deliver such a business was something he could walk into a shop and buy off the shelf
* He believed that the ability to _execute_ on this must be something that eludes the nerds working in such a shop, requiring a true leader, like himself, to capitalise on.

Of course, the cherry on top of that layer cake is my own assumptions - I don't know if any of those things are true. Nevertheless, that line has lived rent-free in my head ever since.

I also remember being acutely impressed by the 'nerd's' handling of that situation. He calmly and professionally answered all of that man's questions, with grace, humility and most importantly, respect. Because odds are, he was a successful small business owner, doing what any half-decent businessperson would do in that situation: talking with a customer, speaking _their_ language, helping them identify their needs and ultimately, if appropriate, selling them a solution.

But even if that's not the case, even if he was a hired employee, the myth still lays in tatters on the floor, well and truly busted. Arguably, more so.

## The Psychology of Relevance

One is reminded of [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) here, or at least a variant thereof. At its core, this behaviour isn’t driven by malice, but rather insecurity.

When power shifts, when the people who _build_ suddenly hold the leverage, those who previously held it need to reclaim their footing. The easiest way for them to do this is by redefining 'leadership':

* If you can’t compete on expertise, compete on perception.
* If _you_ can’t do the work, reframe the ability to do so as a hindrance.
* Knowledge is power, so reframe that knowledge as a burden.

Then repeat it until it becomes dogma. And that's what actually happened - this skewed narrative was so often repeated that we collectively accepted it as gospel. It took a long time to undo, which is why I find it so jarring to see it rear its head again, _especially_ from within the technical space.

## Have We Grown Past It?

A week ago, I would have said yes. Now I'll hedge that a little and say _mostly_.

Today, engineers are, by and large, treated with much more respect, even in sales-first organisations. Ten years ago, sales teams were horrified by the idea of letting a tech anywhere near a customer before the ink was dry.

Boy, was that a mistake. I've seen first-hand how that mentality has cost companies, and individuals for that matter. Nowadays, they realise that credibility sells. My head isn't in the sand here - I'm well aware of the real people from whom the myth stems. I've worked with some very sharp people who absolutely _should_ be kept at arm's length from customers, pre- and post-sales.

Not everyone can communicate clearly, and those who can don't necessarily grasp the tech. Not everyone can get to grips with the importance of the intersection between technology, people and business, but that's ok. The point is everyone is different. Skills are individual and are neither correlated nor mutually exclusive.

## The Real Cost

When organisations separate understanding from decision-making, everyone loses. No, you _can't_ make decisions about deeply technical subjects without at least a fundamental understanding of them. And no, you _can't_ communicate what you don't understand. And, most importantly, you can't build trust by declaring ignorance - and certainly not with pride.

Competence and communication aren’t opposites: they’re parts of the same whole. The best leaders I’ve known are translators - people who grasp the complexity then simplify it without diminishing it.

:::sidenote
This also works both ways, and I've had to learn this lesson myself. I remember one discussion with HR about a problematic employee, who I described at being good at his job but couldn't start his shifts reliably. She said to me, quite rightly, that this does not sound like the description of someone who is good at their job.
:::

The myth of the socially inept specialist has become an unconscious bias, and failure to recognise it is twofold. It can hold you back from using your best resources. Think back to the sales example I mentioned earlier: who is more likely to win a customer, the suave salesperson who thinks they're saying all the right things, or the humble salesperson who brings a technical expert to confidently answer the customer's questions - the questions that _matter?_

Spoiler: that gap widens when those customers ask for references.

Secondly, it costs you at the top line too. Are service delivery managers still a thing? I don't know, I haven't worked in that space for a long time. But I _have_ seen several (this is not an exaggeration) client relationships salvaged by taking them out of the picture.

Real results come from letting all the best people work together - technical experts, domain experts and stakeholders. This is how you deliver results. _This_ is what DDD has been telling us for decades, and the evidence speaks for itself.

## The Balance

This isn't about selling technical skills over leadership skills. Because leadership and management _are_ skills, just like coding, architecture or design. If you want to lead and you already have deep expertise in one, you need to learn the other, irrespective of which side you’re starting from.

I’ve seen technical experts fail at leadership. I’ve _been_ one at times. And I’ve seen non-technical leaders succeed - not by glorifying ignorance but by putting in the hard yards to learn the fundamentals of the craft.

If you're a technical expert or a highly specialised _doer_ and you want to lead, you have to fill in _that_ skills gap. If you're a _leader_ and you want to manage highly specialised individuals or technical experts, you've got some homework to do.

Respect cuts both ways. The best teams are built on humility not hierarchy, where those who _know_ teach those who lead, and those who lead never stop learning.

But the specialist myth? Let's not revive that. It needs to stay dead and buried. At the risk of oversimplifying, whoever you are, you've probably got some incredible, unique and valuable skills. Let's focus on evangelising those, without disparaging the skills of others.
