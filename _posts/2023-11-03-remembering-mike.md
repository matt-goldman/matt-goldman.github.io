This post is a bit different to my usual content, and a bit longer too. For anyone just here for tech and dev stuff, please feel free to skip this one.

Four and a half years ago, on 19th March 2019, my best friend Mike passed away. He was 45 at the time, and today would've been his 50th birthday.

I'm quite a few years younger than Mike, and I remember when he had his 25th birthday at his uni bar, there was a fair bit of teasing about hitting the quarter century mark. 25 seems so young now - but it's funny, today 45 seems somehow even younger.

I first met Mike through his younger brother Scott who I went to school with. Mike accompanied the two of us and another friend, Iain, to [Live! 95](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/live-95-diary-1602829.html), a consumer electronics show. This was the 90s, and gadgets were still cool, and there was still a huge margin between the kind of tech that vendors could show off at these shows and the kinds of things we could imagine having in our homes. It was an exciting day out, no question!

This was my first time meeting Mike, and my first introduction to his unique logic that, while not always evident to the rest of us, can't be argued with. He was flat broke, struggling to pay his way as a student while working part-time, and insisted that no matter what happened, he couldn't possibly spend any money at this event. This made sense, until he revealed that he'd brought Â£700 with him. When I asked why he'd brought that money if there was absolutely no way he could buy anything, he looked at me as if I'd just asked the stupidest question in the world, and said "in case I see something I can't do without." The "duh" was unspoken, but tangible.

This was also Mike's first introduction to my unique nature. I was, to put it bluntly, a little shit, and there's a strong case to be that I haven't entirely outgrown that. I was 14 years old, and had one of those [remote control watches](https://www.amazon.com/Casio-CMD30B-CMD30B1A/dp/B00006I54Q/) that nerds loved myself (man, they really don't make exciting gadgets like they used to). One of the exhibits at this show (I'm pretty sure it was Sanyo, but I could be wrong) had a tunnel of TV screens that you could walk through. This was back before plasma and LCD TVs, when "flat screen" meant minimal curvature on the glass, so these were CRTs mounted to a huge scaffold.

Naturally, after looking up the right code in the watch's manual (which I had evidently brought with me, because this was before smartphones) and laboriously programming it into the watch, I kept sneaking through and, stealthily as possible, aiming in different directions and turning the screens off.

Now, I can look back and acknowledge 100% that this was a dick move, but apparently Mike thought this was hilarious - especially watching the baffled staff unsuccessfully trying to figure out what was wrong with their setup. So it seems the 14 year old little brat made a good impression!

The following week, Scott showed up at school with a carrier bag full of floppy disks that Mike had given him to pass on to me. I was an [Amiga](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/commodore-amiga-at-30-the-computer-that-made-the-uk-games-industry) boy at the time, and Mike had recently moved on from Amiga to PC, which made me the lucky recipient of this treasure trove of games, cover disks, shareware, and [public domain](https://www.amigapd.com/public-domain-libraries-catalogues.html) goodies.

It wasn't long until the Amiga platform started showing early signs of it's own pending tragic premature death,
