## About the Podcast:
Indulge in the perfect blend of technology and beer with us! As two passionate software engineers and homebrewers, we code with one hand and raise a beer with the other. Our episodes cover a diverse range of topics inspired by the tech industry. From high-level developments in AI, cloud, and VR to changes in development practices, industry trends, and leadership stories, we've got it all. And of course, each episode concludes with a little beer talk, celebrating our homebrewing adventures.
