I'm a [Solution Architect working at SSW in Australia](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman/), and I'm excited about sharing my ideas.

Over the course of my career I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the most exciting organisations in the world; a pioneering renewable energy company, a major national sports league, a world-first digital technology hospital, to name just a few. And there’s a common thread that ties all these things together: innovation.

I love innovation. It’s what gets me out of bed in the morning and gets me excited about the projects I work on. I love that I have the opportunity to work with technology that’s straight out of the science fiction stories of my childhood.

But it’s not just technological innovation that excites me. It’s innovation in leadership, teamwork and strategy. I’ve had the privilege of working on innovative developments in these areas too. Sometimes it’s something simple, like having helpdesk technicians in the hospital work with nurses in ICU twice a year to gain a better appreciation for the impact of their service delivery. And sometimes it *is* technology, like building a system to interface the MD’s Macbook to the battery control system on the prototype electric sports car he’s building.

I get excited about innovation, and I have lots of ideas. And here is where I’ll share them. Some of them will be technology related, some of them will be business process related, and some will be both. I’ll make sure I tag them to make it easy to find relevant content.

Feel free to comment, share and follow. Feedback and dialogue is welcome!

Cheers,

Matt
